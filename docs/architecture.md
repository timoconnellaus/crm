# Architecture

An AI-native CRM that each organisation deploys to its own Cloudflare account. Claude (via MCP or the
in-app assistant) can do anything a user can, including reshaping the CRM itself: new objects and
fields, dashboards, automations and custom tools are **code**, written by AI, approved, versioned and
run safely.

Terms are defined in [`CONTEXT.md`](../CONTEXT.md). Decisions and their reasons are in
[`docs/adr/`](adr/). Build order is in [`docs/roadmap.md`](roadmap.md).

## Layers

### 1. Deployment (trusted, changes with releases)

Everything in this repo. Each org runs its own copy ([ADR 0001](adr/0001-self-hosted-single-org.md)),
installed from a release bundle or a fork ([ADR 0012](adr/0012-distribution.md)). The deployment
owns the root of trust: identity, the approval pipeline's floor, the operations registry and the
gatekeepers.

- **`app` Worker**: TanStack Start (SSR + server functions) with shadcn/ui, plus `/mcp`.
- **`runner` Worker**: runs extension code, automations and Workflows.
- **Gatekeeper Workers**: one per external service, vendored from Cloudflare OS
  ([ADR 0007](adr/0007-integrations-are-gatekeepers.md)).

### 2. Operations registry (the one API)

Every thing a user or AI can do is an **operation** defined once in `packages/core`: name, zod input
and output, description (written for a model), required permission, and **risk class**
([ADR 0003](adr/0003-operations-registry.md)). Each operation is exposed three ways from that single
definition:

| Surface | Consumer |
| --- | --- |
| TanStack Start server function | the UI |
| MCP tool | Claude and other MCP clients |
| host module (`codemode:crm`) | extension code in dynamic workers |

Every call passes through the **approval pipeline** before it takes effect. In code that is
`invoke()` in `packages/core` (ADR 0018): validate → gate → role check → handler → one D1 batch
holding the handler's writes, timeline activities and the audit row with field diffs. Handlers
read with Kysely and queue writes; list operations take filter JSON validated against the **field
registry** and compiled to parameterised SQL. `packages/core/README.md` shows how to add one.

### 3. Data

One **D1** database per deployment, with real tables ([ADR 0002](adr/0002-d1-real-tables.md)).

- **Core schema** (`core_*` tables): our versioned migrations, applied on deploy or upgrade. It covers
  the minimal core objects (People, Organisations, Activities, Tasks), users, settings, the approval
  queue and the audit log. Deletes are soft (Trash); a daily cron trigger on `crm-app` purges
  people, organisations, activities and tasks after 30 days through the operations pipeline
  (`trash.purge`), and admin erase redacts the append-only audit log through a sanctioned path
  ([ADR 0019](adr/0019-audit-redaction-for-erasure.md)).
- **Storage retention** ([ADR 0055](adr/0055-storage-retention.md)): D1 stops at 10 GB, so the same
  cron keeps growth bounded. Successful reads by AI, extensions and automations are counted per
  hour (`core_audit_read_counts`) rather than audited row by row. Write audits are kept forever by
  default; an admin can choose 1, 2 or 7 years, and `audit.purge` then deletes older rows through
  a second sanctioned path (purge markers). Run history goes after 30 days (failures 90), decided
  pending actions are compacted to a summary after 30 days, and Settings → Storage shows the
  database size against the cap.
- **Extension schema** (`x_<extension>_*` tables): declared in extension code (`defineObject`) and
  reconciled into D1 by the host, additive-first. Core migrations never touch `x_` tables.
- **`crm.*` views**: generated read views with friendly names, spelled `crm_people`,
  `crm_organisations`, … because D1 has no schemas (ADR 0015 amendment). They are what list
  operations, dashboard SQL and AI queries run against. Since migration 0020 the person,
  organisation, activity and task views are owned by the schema reconciler: core migrations change
  their `core_base_*` views, and the reconciler regenerates `crm_*` over them with extension side
  tables and formulas joined in. Extension objects read through `crm_x_<ext>_<object>`.
- **R2** holds attachments (and, later, large imports: stage-1 CSV imports arrive inline,
  [ADR 0020](adr/0020-query-sql-validator-and-csv-import.md)).

Core migrations are plain SQL in `packages/db/migrations`. Both Workers point their `DB` binding's
`migrations_dir` there, so `wrangler d1 migrations apply` and the in-code runner (`applyMigrations`,
used by tests and upgrades) share one bookkeeping table, `core_migrations`. Each migration also
bumps `core_meta.schema_version`, which `/api/health` compares with the version the code expects.
Typed access to core tables uses Kysely ([ADR 0014](adr/0014-kysely-for-core-schema.md)).

### 4. Extensions (the AI-built layer)

An **extension** is code against one contract (`packages/sdk`): `defineObject`, `defineView` /
`defineDashboard`, `defineAutomation`, `defineTool` ([ADR 0005](adr/0005-extensions.md)).

- **Shipped extensions** live in `extensions/` and ship with releases. Deals/Pipelines is the first.
- **Runtime extensions** are written by Claude in-app or via MCP. They are stored in an
  `@cloudflare/computer` Workspace (a Durable Object filesystem with git), approved as a diff, and
  rolled back by reverting ([ADR 0006](adr/0006-dynamic-runtime-cloudflare-computer.md)).

Extension code runs in Worker Loader dynamic workers with **no network** (`globalOutbound: null`).
It can reach only the host modules it is given: CRM operations, the AI model roles, and enabled
gatekeepers.

How stage 3a built it ([ADR 0040](adr/0040-extension-runtime-build.md)):

- **Contract**: `defineExtension({ id, version, contractVersion, permissions, objects, fields,
  views, tools, automations })` in `packages/sdk`, with every field type and a typed formula
  language compiled to SQLite (`@crm/sdk/formula`). See `packages/sdk/README.md`.
- **Reconciler** (`packages/core/src/extensions/reconciler.ts`): manifest → ordered DDL over
  `x_<ext>_<object>` tables and 1:1 side tables `x_<ext>_<target>`, plus regenerated `crm_*` views,
  dry-run by `extension.check` and applied atomically by `extension.install`.
- **Registry**: extension objects and fields join the field registry (refreshed per invocation), so
  `record.*` operations, filters, saved views, search, CSV export and history work for them. Tools
  are operations `x.<ext>.<tool>`.
- **Runtime** (`apps/runner/src/extensions/`): the `ExtensionWorkspace` DO holds each extension's
  source in its own git repo, builds it (transpile, import check and a TypeScript type check
  against `@crm/sdk`'s declarations), and runs tools with the
  declared `codemode:crm`, `codemode:storage`, `codemode:log` and `codemode:ai` host modules. Code
  acts as principal `extension:<id>` (actor `extension`) within its declared permissions. Runs are
  recorded; 3 consecutive failures quarantine an extension; rollback reinstalls an earlier commit.
- **Shipped extensions** (`extensions/<id>/`, the example first) are bundled as source at build time
  and installed through the same `extension.install` path at boot.
- **UI**: generic list and record pages at `/x/<ext>.<object>`, field widgets for every type,
  extension fields on core record pages, and Settings → Extensions.

How stage 3b added authoring ([ADR 0041](adr/0041-extension-authoring-and-proposals.md)):

```
 MCP client ── extension.write ──► working copy (/extensions/<id>/, uncommitted)
            ── extension.check ──► evaluate + typecheck + contract + formulas + dry-run reconcile
            ── extension.propose ─► commit ─► check ─► diff + host-computed impact (+ build-role
                                    summary) ─► pending action `extension.apply` (risk extension)
 Approvals inbox ── approve ──► approval.approve re-runs extension.apply as the proposer
                                 └─► installExtension: DDL + state + audit + pending status, one batch
```

- `extension.apply` is `alwaysReview`: whatever the actor or preset, it is queued, so a version
  that widens permissions never auto-applies. Approving one needs an admin (`extensions:manage`).
  `extension.approve` / `extension.reject` are the same decision as the inbox, for one proposal.
- The review detail (diff, impact, check, AI summary) is stored by proposal in
  `core_extension_proposals` (migration 0030) and shown on the approval screen.
- Shipped extensions can be extended from another extension but not written in place;
  `extension.eject` copies one into the working copy, and its approved proposal turns it into a
  runtime extension that releases no longer update.
- **Code Mode** ([ADR 0042](adr/0042-code-mode.md)): the MCP `code` tool (operation `code.run`)
  runs a client model's script in a Dynamic Worker as the connected user's `mcp` actor; each
  `crm.call` goes through the pipeline with that user's role, scopes and session, so gates, pending
  actions and simulated reads behave exactly as for tool calls.

### 5. Integrations

All external access goes through **gatekeepers**: reviewed Workers in the repo that own OAuth, expose
a capability API per resource, journal actions and simulate pending ones. We adopt Cloudflare OS's
gatekeeper interface and `gatekeeper-kit` rather than inventing our own. Extension code never reaches
the network directly. `gatekeeper-mcp` lets an admin connect any MCP server at runtime.

### 6. Approval pipeline

Configurable per org ([ADR 0011](adr/0011-approval-pipeline.md)):

1. **Deterministic gate** (code): actor × risk class → `auto` / `deny` / `review`, never below the
   deploy-time floor.
2. **Policy adjudicator** (optional): the `review` model role (Jev or a second LLM) judges the
   simulated change against the org's written policy → approve / deny / escalate.
3. **Human queue**: escalations, with the adjudicator's reasoning attached.

Only human admins can change the policy. Every decision is audited.

The human queue is built (stage 2, [ADR 0022](adr/0022-approval-queue-and-simulation.md),
[ADR 0032](adr/0032-mcp-sessions-and-approval-mechanics.md)); the adjudicator comes in stage 7.
A `review` decision dry-runs the operation and records a **pending action** (diff preview,
simulated result, dependencies, the agent's reason) in a **change set**, then returns
`pending_approval`. The originating MCP session's reads (`get`, `list`, `search.global`,
`activity.listForRecord`) see its pending actions applied, with **provisional IDs** for creates;
everyone else reads real data. A person approves or rejects (`approval.approve` / `reject`):
approval re-runs each action through the pipeline as the original actor, binding provisional to
real ids, and fails an action cleanly if its record changed or was deleted meanwhile. Rejection
cascades to dependents; pending actions expire after `APPROVAL_EXPIRY_DAYS` (default 7).
People review in the **Approvals inbox** (`/approvals`: change sets with readable diffs, approve or
reject whole or per item), with a count in the sidebar and **pending-change badges** on record
headers and list rows (`approval.pendingForRecord`). An erase also scrubs pending actions that
mention the erased record (ADR 0032 amendment).

### MCP

`/mcp` on `crm-app` ([ADR 0021](adr/0021-mcp-surface.md), ADR 0032): `workers-oauth-provider`
wraps the Worker (OAuth 2.1, dynamic client registration, PKCE, one-hour access tokens and
30-day refresh tokens in the `OAUTH_KV` namespace). `/oauth/consent` signs the user in through
the identity adapter and grants scopes `read`, `write` and (admins only) `admin`; effective
permission is role ∩ scopes. Each authorization is a **connected app** (`core_connected_app`),
which is also the MCP session; revoking it stops its tokens at once. `/mcp` is the Agents SDK's
stateless Streamable HTTP handler with an MCP SDK v2 server per request
(`apps/app/src/server/mcp/`): curated tools (operations flagged `mcp: { curated: true }`),
`describe_operations` / `call_operation` for every other MCP-exposed operation, the
`crm://schema` resource and server instructions. Calls run as actor `mcp` with origin
`{ surface: "mcp", clientId, clientName, sessionId }`, rate-limited per connected app. See
[`docs/mcp.md`](mcp.md).

### 7. Identity

A deploy-time **identity adapter** ([ADR 0008](adr/0008-identity-adapters.md)): Better Auth (the
default) or Cloudflare Access, selected by env var. The MCP OAuth 2.1 server sits on top and delegates
login to the active adapter. Identity is never runtime-pluggable.

In `crm-app`, one TanStack Start request middleware resolves the **Principal** for every page
route, server route and server function call. Everything is private by default: only `/sign-in`,
`/api/health`, the adapter's own routes (`/api/auth/*`) and server functions in `*.public.ts` files
are reachable without one. The OAuth routes (`/oauth/*`, `/.well-known/oauth-*`) and `/mcp`
are handled before TanStack Start by the OAuth provider, which checks Bearer tokens itself. A request without a Principal is redirected to sign-in (pages, Better
Auth) or gets a 401 (APIs, server functions, and any request under Cloudflare Access).

### 8. AI

**Model roles** (`build`, `assistant`, `summarise`, `extract`, `classify`, `embed`, `vision`,
`review`) map to a provider and model in a core model registry, which checks capabilities. All calls
go through AI Gateway ([ADR 0009](adr/0009-model-roles.md)). Code asks for a role, never a model.
Workers AI is the default provider for every role. So far the minimal mapping in
`packages/core/src/models.ts` covers `summarise`, `extract`, `classify` (extension code) and
`build` (the AI-written summary on an extension proposal); without an `ai` binding on crm-runner
those features say no AI is available.

### 9. Dashboards and views

A view spec rendered by our own shadcn/chart components. Widgets query with read-only SQL over the
`crm.*` views: the SQL is checked by a SQLite-faithful tokenizer validator (one SELECT/WITH,
`crm_*` views only), takes bound params, and runs with row and time limits
([ADR 0020](adr/0020-query-sql-validator-and-csv-import.md); `validateReadOnlySql` in `@crm/core`,
used by `query.sql`). Computed widgets are extension code. Extensions never ship UI
([ADR 0010](adr/0010-dashboards-sql-views.md)).
